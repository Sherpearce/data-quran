# Tanzil

[Tanzil][tanzil] is an international Quranic project aimed at providing a highly verified precise Quran text in Unicode. It was started back in 2007 and still [active][tanzil-updates] until now. Currently it's the most precise and accurate Quran texts available in internet. If you ever use Quranic apps, chance it uses texts from Tanzil.

Besides the Quran texts, Tanzil also provides Quranic metadata and translations. However, unlike the texts which extracted automatically from Medina Mushaf, the translations are provided by volunteer which means Tanzil cannot guarantee their authenticity and/or accuracy.

## Collected Data and Modifications

Data from Tanzil are collected automatically using the `cli`, except for surah info for Indonesian and Russian language which separated manually. The collected data from Tanzil are put in files prefixed with `*-tanzil.md`.

### Quran Texts

For the texts, we collected every text type from Tanzil:

- Simple
- Simple (Plain)
- Simple (Minimal)
- Simple (Clean)
- Uthmani
- Uthmani (Minimal)

Every text include pause marks, sajdah signs, rub-el-hizb signs and tatweel below superscript alefs. For Uthmani, we don't include texts with sequential tanweens because some Arabic font doesn't render it nicely.

All collected texts are the latest version, which is **version 1.1** that published in February 2021. The collected texts are located in `ayah-text` directory.

Except for format change from plain text to markdown, there are no modifications occured for the Quran texts.

### Quran Metadata

For the metadata, Tanzil provides a [JS file][tanzil-meta-js] which contains surah, juz, hizb quarter, manzil, ruku, page and sajda. From this JS file, we convert and split it into several JSON files:

- Sura into `surah/surah.json` and `surah-translation/en-tanzil.json`.
- Juz into `meta/juz.json`.
- Hizb quarter into `meta/maqra.json`. For the sake of completion, we also create `meta/hizb.json` from the hizb quarter.
- Manzil into `meta/manzil.json`.
- Ruku into `meta/ruku.json`.
- Page into `meta/page.json`.
- Sajda into `meta/sajda.json`.

All collected metadata are the latest version, which is **version 1.0** that published in February 2008. There are no modifications except for converting JS into JSON.

### Quran Translations

When these data collected, Tanzil provides 115 translations in plain text for 44 languages. After checking the files one-by-one, they are separated into four types:

- Translation
- Transliteration
- Tafsir
- Surah information

There are several modifications done to those translation files:

- Put `TODO:MISSING` to files where there are missing translation entries.
- Put `TODO:DUPLICATE` to files where there are duplicate entries.
- Remove HTML formatting from `en.transliteration`.
- Separate surah info from tafsir `id.muntakhab` and `ru.muntahab`.
